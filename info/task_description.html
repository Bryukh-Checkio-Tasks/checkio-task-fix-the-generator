    <p>With the keypad fixed, Sofia quickly jabs the password in and presses Enter. A section of the wall behind the
        robotic trio hisses, a cloud of steam bursts forth and it rumbles open. Sofia, every the excitable explorer
        steps in first.</p>

    <p>“Drat! It’s so dark in here I can’t see a thing!” She calls out to Nikola and Stephen who are standing in the
        door frame, staring into the darkness.</p>

    <p>“Do you see a light switch?” Stephen asked Sofia.</p>

    <p>“Nnnnoooo, I don’t... But there is this big metal thing.”</p>

    <p>“Hang on.” Nikola says. He runs back to the spaceship and returns quickly. “Here Sofia, take this.” He hands her
        a flashlight.</p>

    <p>“Thanks.” She turns it on. “Looks like some kind of generator. Maybe if I -”</p>

    <p>“NO!” Stephen interrupted her. “Last time you touched a generator, Dad’s truck got spaghettified in a black
        hole!”</p>

    <p>“Well someone should fix it.”</p>

<p>
    You are given number of sticks (N). These sticks are represented in a list by their length (integers). For this
    mission, you should calculate the number of combinations that cannot form a complete triangle (for this
    mission, the degenerated case when a+b=c is considered to be a complete triangle too). If you can figure out
    which triangles do not work, you can help Nikola and Stephen repair the generator.
</p>
<p>
    For example: in the list of lengths [5, 2, 9, 6] the combinations (5, 2, 9) and (2, 9, 6) would not form a complete
    triangle, because 5+2<9 and 2+6<9.
    This means that out of all the possible combinations of numbers in that list, only 2 would not form a complete triangle.
